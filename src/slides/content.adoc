MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

== 0.x Versions?

[quote, SemVer-specification]
Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.

== Patch

[quote, SemVer-specification]
Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.

== Minor

[quote, SemVer-specification]
Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public API.

== Minor

[quote, SemVer-specification]
It MUST be incremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated.

== Minor

[quote, SemVer-specification]
It MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes. Patch version MUST be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.

== Major

[quote, SemVer-specification]
Major version X (X.y.z | X > 0) MUST be incremented if any backwards incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. It MAY include minor and patch level changes. Patch and minor version MUST be reset to 0 when major version is incremented.
