== The workflows

=== Version in buildfile(s)

Developer triggers CI (optional parameters)

[cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|
* Build "`-SNAPSHOT`" (check if it's working)
* Remove "`-SNAPSHOT`"
* Commit and push
* Create and push tag
* Increase Version, append "`-SNAPSHOT`"
|
* Commit/Push
* Checkout tag
* Build version
* Publish artifacts
* Checkout branch head

Problems:

* Needs to build twice
* Needs to change build-scripts
=> Potential merge conflicts
--

=== => Maven Release Plugin and some Gradle Plugins

=== Version in VCS

Developer triggers CI (optional parameters)

* Build version
* Create and push tag
* Publish artefacts

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Version either inferred from last tag or given as parameter

=== => the other Gradle Plugins

== But first

[.important]
What's the new version?

=== Versioning Schemes

* ${major}
* ${major}.${minor}
* ${major}.${minor}.${patch}
* ${major}.${minor}.${patch}.${qualifier}
* ${major}.${minor}.${patch}-RCx
* ${major}.${minor}.${patch}-FINAL
* TeX
* Windows
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning[...]

[NOTE.speaker]
TeX: Kreiszahl Pi
Windows (3.11, 95, 98, Millenium, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 10)

== http://semver.org/[SemVer] anyone?

=== MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

=== Patch

[quote, SemVer-specification]
Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.

=== Minor

[quote, SemVer-specification]
Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public API.

=== Minor

[quote, SemVer-specification]
It MUST be incremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated.

=== Minor

[quote, SemVer-specification]
It MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes. Patch version MUST be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.

=== Major

[quote, SemVer-specification]
Major version X (X.y.z | X > 0) MUST be incremented if any backwards incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. It MAY include minor and patch level changes. Patch and minor version MUST be reset to 0 when major version is incremented.

=== 0.x Versions?

[quote, SemVer-specification]
Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.

== Release notes anyone

[NOTE.speaker]
--
No release notes at all.
--

=== Use Bugtracker

image::glazedlists-automatic-releasenotes.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Just point to a filtered bug list.
--

=== Use Commit message conventions ...

image::angular-commit-message-convention.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]

Angular.js defined commit message conventions ...

=== ... to generate ...

... to generate releasenotes.

=== ... the release notes

[NOTE.speaker]

These auto generated release notes are attached to the Github releases.

== Breaking changes sneaking in

But since the creation of the version does not parse the commit messages, ...

Stephan Bönnemann created a build process called "`Semantic Release`" to mitigate this problem.

He created a word for the reason, why so many feature or patch versions also contain breaking changes: ...

=== Haupt&shy;versions&shy;nummern&shy;erhöhungs&shy;angst

[NOTE.speaker]

Because I wanted to be able to use that concept for my builds, I implemented his ideas as a Gradle plugin.

== Demo

video::demo.mp4[]

== How does it work

* Version is inferred using the last tag (if any) and the commit messages
* Only creates new version if any feature or fix commit
* No tag yet => v1.0.0
* Only fixes => increment PATCH
* Any features => increment +++<del>MINOR</del>+++ FEATURE
* Any breaking features => increment +++<del>MAJOR</del>+++ BREAKING

== Default Branches

* master
* release/1.2.x
* release/1.x

[NOTE.speaker]
--
By default the plugin does only create versions on master and on release branches.

On release/1.2.x it would only allow bugfix commits. If a feature commit was introduced, the release will fail.

On release/1.x it would only allow bugfix and feature commits, but no BREAKING CHANGES. If a breaking change was introduced, the release will fail.
--

== Remember this?

Developer triggers CI (optional parameters)

* Build version
* Create and push tag
* Publish artefacts

=== Becomes

Developer pushes to master

* Build version
* Create and push tag
* Publish artefacts

== Possible workflows

== Work on master

=== New local feature commit

+++<canvas id="masterOneFeature"></canvas>+++

=== Push

+++<canvas id="originMasterOneFeature"></canvas>+++

=== New local bugfix commit

+++<canvas id="masterOneFix"></canvas>+++

=== Push

+++<canvas id="originMasterOneFix"></canvas>+++

=== Multiple local commits

+++<canvas id="masterMultiple"></canvas>+++

=== Push

+++<canvas id="originMasterMultiple"></canvas>+++

===  => every push triggers new version

(if bugfix or feature commit since last tag)

== Git-Flow, GitHub-Flow, etc.

=== With Release-Branches

+++<canvas id="gitflow"></canvas>+++

=== Without Release-Branches

+++<canvas id="gitflowWithoutRelease"></canvas>+++

=== => merge to master (or release/1.x) triggers new version

== Customizations

=== RCx-versions

[source,groovy]
----
release {
    versionStrategy semanticRelease.releaseStrategy.copyWith(
        type: 'rc', // <1>
        selector: { SemVerStrategyState state ->
            !state.repoDirty && state.currentBranch.name ==~ /rc\/.*/ &&
                    semanticRelease.semanticStrategy.canRelease(state) &&
                    project.gradle.startParameter.taskNames.find { it == 'release' }
        },
        preReleaseStrategy: StrategyUtil.all({
            it.copyWith(inferredPreRelease: 'rc')
        } as PartialSemVerStrategy, Strategies.PreRelease.COUNT_INCREMENTED)
    )
}
----
<1> the type is important, without type you would replace the default strategy

[NOTE.speaker]
--
By default, pre-release versions will not be generated, but it is possible, to add this to the build.
--

=== Add "`-FINAL`" to the release

[source,groovy]
----
release {
    // replace the default strategy to add '-FINAL' to the version
    versionStrategy semanticRelease.releaseStrategy.copyWith{
        preReleaseStrategy: { it.copyWith(inferredPreRelease: 'FINAL') }
    }
}
